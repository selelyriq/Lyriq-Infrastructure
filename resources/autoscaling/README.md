Here’s a README for your Autoscaling module:



# Autoscaling Module

## Description
This Terraform module provisions an autoscaling group for a web server. The configuration includes a launch template, placement group for clustered instances, and a minimal IAM role for managing autoscaling actions. The setup is designed to automatically scale instances based on demand, ensuring the webserver’s availability and performance.

## Architecture
This module provisions the following resources:
- **AWS Launch Template**: Defines the AMI and instance type for EC2 instances in the autoscaling group.
- **AWS Placement Group**: Ensures that instances are clustered together to enhance networking performance.
- **AWS Autoscaling Group**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances between the configured minimum and maximum sizes based on load.
- **IAM Role**: Grants the autoscaling group the necessary permissions for scaling lifecycle management.

## Prerequisites
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- AWS CLI with configured credentials.

## Usage

1. **Add the module to your Terraform configuration:**
   ```hcl
   module "autoscaling" {
     source = "./modules/autoscaling"
   }

	2.	Initialize and apply the module:

terraform init
terraform apply



Variables

The module currently expects the following input variables:

	•	public_subnet_id: The ID of the public subnet where the EC2 instances will be deployed.
	•	private_subnet_id: The ID of the private subnet for additional instance deployment.
	•	scaling_queue_arn: The ARN of the SQS queue for lifecycle notifications.
	•	iam_role_arn: The ARN of the IAM role for managing lifecycle hooks.

Outputs

The following outputs are provided:

	•	autoscaling_group_name - The name of the autoscaling group.
	•	scaling_role_arn - The ARN of the IAM role for autoscaling.
	•	scaling_role_name - The name of the IAM role for autoscaling.
