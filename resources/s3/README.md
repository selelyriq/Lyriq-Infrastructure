Here’s a README for your S3 bucket module, supporting the initial setup for cross-region replication:



# S3 Bucket Module

## Description
This Terraform module provisions two S3 buckets—one as the **source** and one as the **destination**—to enable cross-region replication. Currently, the setup includes base resources such as bucket creation and versioning. Full cross-region replication functionality is still in progress, as IAM permissions for replication are being worked on.

## Architecture
This module provisions the following resources:
- **Source S3 Bucket**: Created in the specified AWS region for storing the original data. Versioning is enabled.
- **Destination S3 Bucket**: Created in a different AWS region for future replication. Versioning is also enabled.

The module is designed to eventually support cross-region replication, but currently only the base resources for replication (buckets and versioning) are set up.

## Prerequisites
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- AWS CLI with configured credentials.
- S3 bucket and IAM roles for replication (to be added).

## Usage

1. **Add the module to your Terraform configuration:**
   ```hcl
   module "s3_replication" {
     source = "./modules/s3"
   }

	2.	Initialize and apply the module:

terraform init
terraform apply



Variables

At the moment, this module uses static configurations. Future versions will include variable support for regions, replication configuration, and IAM permissions.

Outputs

The following outputs are provided:

	•	bucket_name - Name of the source S3 bucket.
	•	bucket_arn - ARN of the source S3 bucket.

This README outlines the current state of your S3 replication module, highlighting that the cross-region replication setup is still in progress due to pending IAM permission configuration.
